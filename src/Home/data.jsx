      <p key="1">Executive Director</p>,
      <p key="2">Zeid orignally hails from Georgia, USA but grew up splitting his time between Damascus, Syria and Michigan, USA. The idea for Lazzzy orginated with Zeid, stemming from his own desire for better highlighting/organization tools throughout his variety of acadmic pursuits yet failing to find any practical solutions to the system overload of online academic resources available to him. His favorite hobbies are reading/video games and currently maintains a solid 1.3 KDA on Call of Duty. When asked how does he <i>embrace the lazzzy Zeid</i> he replied, “when I get a food coma in the middle of a meal, I take a nap to finish my food later.” </p>,

      <p key="2">Ari orignally hails from New Jersey, USA but grew up so close to NYC that you are able to see the city skyline from his childhood home. Ari is a sports buff and proudly admits to the misery that comes with being a New York Mets fan. He is an ultimate frisbee aficionado and currently plays for the UMich club team. His favorite hobby is cooking and currently lives with four others who cannot, so he gets to experiment with new recipes. Food is what led Ari to his last position at an Italian food manufacturer/distributor, Mama Mancini’s, where he was able to work and learn directly from their COO in logistics and inventory management. When asked how does he <i>embrace the lazzzy Ari</i> he replied, “I embrace the lazy me by knowing how much to do in as little time as possible.”</p>,

His favorite hobbies outside of smashing through offensive lines and sacking quarterbacks on Saturday's are golfing, playing video games, and skiing. When asked how does he <i>embrace the lazzzy Julius</i> he replied, “What lazy means to me is instead of what you typically think, it's that I'd rather work smarter not harder. That's what being lazy means to me. More free time to myself.  With Lazzzy I am going to save a lot of time I can finally use to focus on my other hobbies I don't have time for as a student-athlete.”</p>,
