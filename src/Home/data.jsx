He was born in Georgia, USA but grew up between Damascus, Syria and Michigan, USA. Incepting the idea out of his own desire for better highlighting and organization, Zeid invented Lazzzy as a solution to the system overload of online academic resources. When asked how he “embraces the lazzzy Zeid” he said, “when I get a food coma in the middle of a meal, I take a nap to finish my food later…” </p>,

He was born and raised in New Jersey, USA, having lived so close to NYC you’re able to see the city skyline from his childhood home. Ari is a sports buff and proudly admits to the misery that comes with being a New York Mets fan. He is an ultimate frisbee aficionado and currently plays for the UMich club team. His favorite hobby is cooking and currently lives with four others who cannot, so he gets to experiment with new recipes. Food is what led Ari to his last position at an Italian food manufacturer/distributor, Mama Mancini’s, where he was able to work and learn directly from their COO in logistics and inventory management. When asked how he “embraces the lazzzy Ari” he replied, “I embrace the lazy me by knowing how much to do in as little time as possible.”</p>,
